package com.akshay.progs;

// By using "class" keyword with accessibility modifier, we can create class
public class Signature's { 
	//this is class
	// inside { } (brackets) - class body
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// this is main method body
		// by using accessibility modifier and return type we can create method
		// and inside the method we can write our logic
		
		//By using class name we can create class's object
		Signature s = new Signatures();
	}
